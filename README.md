## Editions

This repository is for "prism v4" which is a _complete_ rewrite of the plugin from previous versions.

Prism was originally started by viveleroi in 2012, briefly taken over by another team in 2020, returned to viveleroi and renamed "PrismRefracted".

A rewrite is always needed after a decade of evolution.

This repository was split off of the original for a cleaner history.
